queue is a linear ds which operates in fifo and last in last out order

abstract data type with a bounded capacity
//abstract data types are definitions of data and operations but do not have implementation details

front/head at the start and rear/back at the end
enqueue is a linear ds which operates in added at one end(raer end)

dequeue is a linear ds which operates by removing from the other end(front/head end)


//operations 
enqueue()  
dequeue()
isFull()   -> rear==size(arr)-1 return true
isEmpty()  -> front==-1 && rear==-1 return true
count()   

//used in cpu scheduling,disk scheduling

queue makes the front value 0 and when the arr is filled it shows queue is full and so the front
0 0 2 6 7 is also considered as full 

for a citcular linked list only difference is rear=(Rear+1)%N;
