Graph is collection of vertices and edges connecting these vertices

Directed Edge -> One way connection. 
Undirected edge -> Two way connection 
Directed graph -> All directed edges 
Undirected graph -> All undirected edges.

Edge is defined by its two endpoints and

Graph Is used to model paths in city, social network.Website backlinks.

Indegree is no of edges going out of the node
Outdegree is no of edges coming into the node

>Representation of graphs
Adjacency list mark the nodes with the list of its neighbors
Adjaceny matrix -Aij =1 for an edge between i and j,0 otherwise;
Cost Adjaceny matrix instead of 1 comes the cost and instead of 0 -1 is filled only in cases where cost can be 0
Cost Adjaceny list - cost is stored along with the createLinkedList
Compact List representation- the entire graph is stored in 1d array

>Graph traversal
two algorithms of graph traversal are->
BFS breadth first search
DFS depth first search

in graph traversal algorithm we traverse through all hte nodes of a graph and add it to the collection of visited nodes and
exploring a vertex means visiting all the connected vertices of the graph

BFS traversal  <queuue>
We start with a note and start exploring it's connected notes. The same process is repeated with all the connecting notes until all the notes are visited.
tru to construct the bfs spanning tree, then do the level order traversal

two queues of traversal
->visited ->exploration queue

DFS traversal <stack>

Subgraph
A sub graph of a graph G is a graph whose vertices and edges are subsets of the original graph G.

Connected graph -> if there is a path from one point to another point then its is connected
Complete graph -> every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge

connected subgraph is said to be spanning tree of graph G. If all the vertices of G must be present in this S and the number of edges in as should be V-1.
a complete graph has pow(n,n-2) where n is the number of vertices in the graph

a minimum spanning tree is the spanning tree with minimum cost

prims algorithms
->Greedy approaches
->we start with any node and create a minimum spanning tree
->we grow the spanning tree from a starting position until n-1 edges are fromed
