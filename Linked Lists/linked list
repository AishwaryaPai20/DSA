linked list 
non contiguous list -> linear data structure
connected using pointers
consist of nodes consisting data and reference to the next node in the list

linked list vs array list

pro -> dynamic size, ease of insertion deletion 

cons -> random access is not allowed ,only sequentially elements can be accessed 
extra memory space for a pointer is required 
not cache friendly 

Operations in linked list
    
traversing list
append a new node (to the end)
prepend a new node(to the start of the list)
inserting a new node to a specific position in the list
deleting a new node from a specific position in the list
updating a node in the list   ( unique key is also added )

in doubly linked list
there is p= previous node 
d= data and n =nodes
can go both forward and backward in the list

in circular linked list no null 

implementing in stack,queue,hash table,graphs
