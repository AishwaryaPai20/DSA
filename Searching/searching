two searching types
1)sequential searching  
element by element  -> linear search -> not sorted
2)interval searching    
element in interval -> binary search -> sorted

linear search 
worst case when element is found at last element
time is O(n) 

binary search 
sorted array is searched by dividing it in the half
time complexity is O(log n)
