Tree is a non linear data structure 
every binary tree has 2 nodes left and right
when no more nodes are present at the bottom level
both the left and right points to NULL

We use recursion in trees to traverse within its unknown length
shortcut for traversal 

1. travel along the edges
2. for 
preorder (root->left->right) so print the elements in its first visit
inorder (left->root->right) so print the elements in its second visit
postorder (left->right->root) so print the elements in its third visit

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each parent node can have at most two children. Each node of a binary tree consists of three items:
data item
address of left child
address of right child

A full Binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every parent node/internal node has either two or no children.

A perfect binary tree is a type of binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two child nodes and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.

A complete binary tree is just like a full binary tree, but with two major differences
Every level must be completely filled
All the leaf elements must lean towards the left.
The last leaf element might not have a right sibling i.e. a complete binary tree doesn't have to be a full binary tree.

Balanced Binary Tree is a type of binary tree in which the difference between the height of the left and the right subtree for each node is either 0 or 1.

Deletion of node with two children
->Deleted node is replaced with either highest value in left sub tree or least value in right sub tree

AVL trees
Balanced Factor=Height of right subtree-Height of left subtree

shoulld be -1,0,1 for avl trees |BF|<=1

LL Rotation -< clockwise directiona
RR Rotation -> anticlockwise direction
LR Rotation  -> anti then clockwise direction
RL Rotation -> clockwise then anti

For Imbalanced trees

Left-Left Insertion -> Right rotate once
Right- Right Insertion -> Left roatte once
Left- Right Insertion -> Left Rotate once then right rotate once
Right-Left Insertion -> Right rotate once then left rotate once

in right left insertion right rotate is done wrt to rightchild of first imbalanced node 

Trees is also a graph
