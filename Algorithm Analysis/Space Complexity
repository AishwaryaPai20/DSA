Space Complexity 
memory required by an algorithm to execute a program and produce output. 
space is represented by big O Notation
-> it includes both auxillary space and space used by input functions

-> Auxillary space ->temporary space allocated by your algorithm to solve the problem ,,excluding the input size

constant space -> O(1)
linear space -> O(n)
//space remains the same even after n iterations so it will give a constant bytes

factorial of a number

iterative using for loops -> O(1)
recursive using n*fact(n-1) ->O(n)
